### Design pattern practice task #2

---

The goal of this task is to change the code to make it more concise and less error-prone.

You **DO NOT** need to change the output of the code or change the features.

You **NEED** to refactor the code. 

Comments will indicate whether a class or method is allowed to be changed or not. 

Requirements:
 - Refactor the code to use a design pattern
 - Do not change functionality
 - Implement changes to hb-application project.
 - Do not change anything in the image-host-library project. You can think of it as third party dependency.
 - You can run the hb-application/src/main/java/com/epam/Application.java to test if the code compiles.

hints: 
- There are duplicate code parts.
- The image-host-library have a complex API.
- There are no clear layers.
