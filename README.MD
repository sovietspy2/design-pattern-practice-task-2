### Design pattern practice task #2

---

The goal of this task is to change the code to make it more concise and less error-prone.

You **DO NOT** need to change the output of the code or change the functionality.

You **NEED** to refactor the code.

Comments will indicate whether a class or method is allowed to be changed or not.

Requirements:

- Refactor the code to use a _fitting_ design pattern!
- Do not change functionality!
- Implement changes to _hb-application_ project!
- Do not change anything in the image-host-library project! You can think of it as third party dependency.
- Feel free to add and remove files based on the rules specified earlier.
- You can run the `hb-application/src/main/java/com/epam/Application.java` to test if the code still works.
